## Purpose
Step1. Learn how to use Firebase with Vanilla JS
Step2. Learn how to refactoring step1 using react-redux

## About structure
This repository's structure is a little bit strange, because we did not start from React, but we start from simple `index.html` and `main.js` without any library or framework(Vanilla JS).
And then, we try to use `React` framework.

`firebase -V`

`yarn start`

## React build

`yarn build`
